# BigQuery Integration Status

This document outlines the current status of BigQuery integration in the Fallback MVP project, including test cases, known issues, and future improvements.

## Integration Summary

The Fallback MVP project now fully integrates with Google BigQuery to power data-driven widgets and grounded chat responses. The following components have been updated:

1. **Widget Components**: All dashboard widgets now fetch live data from BigQuery
2. **Router Integration**: Domain detection routes queries to the appropriate BigQuery template
3. **Perplexity AI**: Chat responses are grounded in live BigQuery data with specialized system prompts
4. **Fallback Handling**: Graceful fallbacks to static data when queries fail or return no results

## Test Cases

### 1. Widget Data Loading

| Test Case | Expected Behavior | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Business Units Widget | Loads business units data from BigQuery with YoY trends | ✅ Passing |
| Top Counterparties Widget | Loads top customers with revenue data from BigQuery | ✅ Passing |
| Monthly Trend Widget | Loads monthly trend data with calculated changes | ✅ Passing |
| Widget Error Handling | Falls back to static JSON data when BigQuery fails | ✅ Passing |

### 2. Domain Detection & Routing

| Test Case | Expected Behavior | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Performance Domain | Detects "performance" keywords, routes to business_units_snapshot_yoy_v1 | ✅ Passing |
| Counterparties Domain | Detects "customers" keywords, routes to customers_top_n | ✅ Passing |
| Risk Domain | Detects "risk" keywords, routes to risks_summary | ✅ Passing |
| No Domain Match | Returns domain "none" with 0 confidence | ✅ Passing |

### 3. Perplexity AI Grounding

| Test Case | Expected Behavior | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Grounded Chat - With Data | Sends BigQuery data to Perplexity API in structured format | ✅ Passing |
| Grounded Chat - No Data | Sends special system prompt when no data is available | ✅ Passing |
| Narrative Generation | LLM generates business-focused narratives based on data | ✅ Passing |
| Cross-Domain Questions | Detects correct domain and uses appropriate data | ✅ Passing |

### 4. Error Handling

| Test Case | Expected Behavior | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| BigQuery API Error | Falls back gracefully with appropriate user messaging | ✅ Passing |
| Perplexity API Error | Returns friendly error message to user | ✅ Passing |
| Missing Credentials | Checks for GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS at startup | ✅ Passing |
| Invalid SQL Template | Reports diagnostic information for debugging | ✅ Passing |

## Known Issues

1. **Performance**: Initial BigQuery queries may have higher latency (~1-2 seconds)
2. **Cold Start**: First query after deployment may take longer due to serverless cold starts
3. **Rate Limiting**: Excessive queries may hit BigQuery or Perplexity rate limits

## Future Improvements

1. **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis or in-memory caching for frequent queries
2. **Parameter Extraction**: Extract more query parameters from user messages
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Add more sophisticated analytical templates beyond current set
4. **Multi-Query Support**: Allow chat responses to draw from multiple BigQuery templates
5. **Cross-Domain Insights**: Enable LLM to connect insights across business domains
