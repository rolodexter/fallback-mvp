# Fallback MVP Stage 3 Status Report

## Summary
All Stage 3 deliverables have been successfully implemented to stabilize deployment and enable a functional router and template system for the Fallback MVP project. This report details the completed tasks, their implementation details, and recommendations for next steps.

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Platform Detection for API Endpoints
- Created health endpoints for both Vercel (`/api/health.ts`) and Netlify (`/functions/health.ts`) that return platform identification
- Implemented platform detection in `chatClient.ts` to automatically detect and use the correct endpoint:
  - Vercel: `/api/chat`
  - Netlify: `/.netlify/functions/chat`
- Added initialization logic to ensure platform detection happens before sending messages
- Added debug information to `window.__riskillDebug` object for troubleshooting

### 2. Router Implementation
- Created a keyword-based router in `src/data/router/router.ts`
- Implemented domain detection for: performance, counterparties, and risk
- Scoring system with confidence threshold (0.3) to prevent false positives
- Integrated router into ChatPanel component for message processing
- Debug information updated with domain and confidence scores

### 3. Template Registry
- Created template registry in `src/data/templates/template_registry.json` with:
  - Domain-specific schema IDs
  - Summary function mappings
  - Grounding narrative IDs
- Implemented helper functions in `src/data/templates/index.ts` to:
  - Load template registry
  - Fetch summary functions by domain
  - Generate domain-specific summaries

### 4. CSS Organization
- Extracted and centralized component CSS:
  - `/src/styles/chat.css` for chat components
  - `/src/styles/widgets.css` for widget components
  - `/src/styles/index.css` as the main import file with CSS variables
- Removed local CSS imports from components
- Added CSS variables for consistent styling

### 5. Debug Overlay
- Added a debug overlay to the ChatPanel component that displays:
  - Current API endpoint
  - Detected platform (Vercel/Netlify)
  - Router domain and confidence score
  - Template ID in use
- Overlay visible when `?debug=1` is added to the URL

## Verification
- Platform detection successfully chooses the correct endpoint based on deployment environment
- Router correctly identifies domains based on message content
- Template registry properly maps domains to summary functions
- CSS organization ensures consistent styling across platforms
- Debug overlay provides visibility into application state

## Next Steps
1. Improve router accuracy with more sophisticated NLP techniques
2. Add real data integration to template summary functions
3. Expand template registry with more domains
4. Add comprehensive unit tests for router and template functions
5. Enhance chat UI with domain-specific styling based on detected domain
6. Consider implementing a feedback mechanism to improve router accuracy over time

## Conclusion
The Stage 3 deliverables have successfully addressed the deployment stability issues and implemented the core functionality required for domain-specific chat interactions. The application can now:

1. Automatically detect the deployment platform
2. Route user messages to appropriate domains
3. Use templates to generate domain-specific responses
4. Provide debug information for development and troubleshooting

These improvements establish a solid foundation for the remaining MVP development stages.
