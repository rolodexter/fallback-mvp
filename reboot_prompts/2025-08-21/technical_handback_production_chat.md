# REBOOT PROMPT: FALLBACK MVP PRODUCTION CHAT INTEGRATION IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

## PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATUS

### Implementation Stage
- **Current Stage**: Stage 4 - Production Chat Integration
- **Deployment Status**: Successfully deployed to Netlify/Windsurf at https://fallback-mvp-dashboard.windsurf.build
- **Project ID**: bef90b9f-7b58-454c-814e-4902f3456ac2 (fallback-mvp-dashboard-tdp05)

### Core Components Implemented
1. **LLM Provider Abstraction** (`src/services/llmProvider.ts`)
   - Provider switching capability with initial Perplexity API support
   - Structured for future extension to Anthropic, OpenRouter, etc.
   - System prompt configured for maritime analytics context

2. **Serverless Functions**
   - Netlify function: `netlify/functions/chat.ts`
   - Vercel function: `api/chat.ts`
   - Both integrated with LLM provider abstraction
   - Error handling and CORS support implemented

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Chat client with automatic platform detection
   - Environment-aware configuration (development vs. production)
   - Mock Service Worker disabled in production builds

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Environment variables example in `.env.example`
   - TypeScript declarations in `vite-env.d.ts`
   - Platform-specific environment setup documented

## CURRENT ISSUES & NEXT STEPS

### Identified Issues
1. **Chat Quality Problem**: 
   - The deployed chat is not providing domain-relevant responses
   - Investigation reveals missing API key configuration in Netlify deployment
   - Generic explanatory responses appearing instead of context-aware answers

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - API keys need to be configured in Netlify environment settings:
     - `PROVIDER`: perplexity
     - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`: [actual API key needed]
     - `VITE_DEPLOY_PLATFORM`: netlify

### Immediate Next Actions
1. Configure Perplexity API key in Netlify environment settings
2. Trigger redeploy after environment variable configuration
3. Test with domain-specific questions to verify intelligent responses
4. Consider enhancing system prompt for more relevant maritime domain responses

## FILE STRUCTURE & IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Key Files Modified
1. `src/services/llmProvider.ts` - New abstraction layer for LLM providers
2. `netlify/functions/chat.ts` - New serverless function for Netlify
3. `api/chat.ts` - Updated Vercel serverless function
4. `src/mocks/browser.ts` - Updated MSW configuration
5. `src/main.tsx` - Updated MSW initialization
6. `.env.example` - Expanded environment variable documentation
7. `src/vite-env.d.ts` - Added TypeScript declarations
8. `README.md` - Updated with configuration instructions
9. `STATUS.md` - Created with verification status

### Implementation Architecture
- **Front-end**: React application with chat panel component
- **API Layer**: Serverless functions on Netlify/Vercel
- **Provider Layer**: Abstraction for different LLM services
- **Development**: MSW for mock API responses in development

## VERIFICATION & TESTING STATUS

### Local Development Testing
- ✅ MSW mock service correctly intercepts API calls in development
- ✅ Chat requests properly route through LLM provider abstraction
- ✅ Environment variable configuration works as expected
- ✅ Type safety maintained throughout the application

### Platform Deployment
- ✅ Netlify/Windsurf deployment completed
- ❌ API key configuration pending in Netlify environment settings
- ❓ Cross-platform endpoint detection needs verification
- ✅ Production builds correctly disable MSW

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

1. Add support for additional LLM providers beyond Perplexity
2. Enhance domain-specific prompt engineering for maritime context
3. Implement better error handling for API rate limits and outages
4. Create more specialized response templates for different financial domains
5. Add automated tests for the chat functionality
6. Deploy and verify on Vercel platform

## CURRENT WORKING CONTEXT

The current focus is on ensuring the deployed application correctly connects to the Perplexity API for intelligent chat responses. The missing API key in the Netlify environment is preventing the production application from delivering domain-relevant responses. Once this is resolved, further enhancements to the system prompt can be considered for improved response quality.
