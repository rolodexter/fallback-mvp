# Technical-to-Strategic Handback: Fallback MVP Project

## 1. Implementation Summary & Technical Achievements

### Current Implementation Status
- **Project Stage**: Stage 2 (Chat Backend) completed
- **Framework**: Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Deployment Targets**: Dual deployment configurations for both Netlify and Vercel
- **Code Structure**: Modular component architecture with separation of concerns
- **API Integration**: Perplexity sonar model integration with system prompt templates
- **Data Visualization**: Three dashboard widgets implemented with mock data

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Stage 0 (Bootstrap)**:
  - Created foundational project structure with all required directories and files
  - Implemented basic React components for dashboard layout, widget shells, and chat interface
  - Set up dual-deployment configuration with `netlify.toml` and `vercel.json`

- **Stage 1 (Layout + Mock Widgets)**:
  - Created mock data directory with JSON files for all three widgets
  - Implemented BusinessUnits widget with sparklines, current/previous values, and percent change
  - Implemented TopCounterparties widget with sortable data and trend visualization
  - Implemented MonthlyTrend widget with bar chart comparing current vs previous year
  - Styled all widgets as cards with consistent design language

- **Stage 2 (Chat Backend)**:
  - Added `.env` support for Perplexity API key management
  - Implemented `/api/chat` endpoint for Vercel deployment
  - Implemented `/.netlify/functions/chat` endpoint for Netlify deployment
  - Developed chat client service with platform detection
  - Enhanced ChatPanel UI with message history, loading states, and error handling
  - Added basic domain-aware system prompts based on conversation context

### Technical Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Creating responsive visualizations for financial data
- **Solution**: Utilized `react-sparklines` for trend visualization and `recharts` for more complex charts
- **Challenge**: Supporting both Netlify and Vercel serverless functions
- **Solution**: Implemented platform-specific API handlers with shared business logic
- **Challenge**: Handling API key security
- **Solution**: Utilized environment variables with `.env` file (gitignored) and `.env.example` template

## 2. Strategic Insights & Business Implications

### Design Philosophy
- Dashboard follows "data at a glance" principle with the most critical metrics visible immediately
- Chat interface provides contextual support and deeper insights based on the visible data
- Domain-aware AI responses adapt to business context (performance, counterparties, risk)
- Error handling gracefully degrades functionality when API services are unavailable

### Technical Capabilities & Limitations
- **Capabilities**:
  - Responsive visualization of financial metrics with YoY comparisons
  - AI-powered conversational interface with domain-specific context
  - Serverless architecture supports scalable deployment
  - Platform-agnostic design works on both Netlify and Vercel
- **Limitations**:
  - Currently using static mock data without real-time updates
  - Basic domain detection without sophisticated NLP understanding
  - Limited error recovery options when AI service is unavailable

### User Experience Considerations
- Dashboard layout prioritizes data visualization (3 widgets in top row)
- Chat interface positioned below widgets provides contextual assistance
- Loading states, error messages, and visual feedback enhance UX reliability
- Domain tracking shows users which business context the AI is operating in

## 3. Documentation Requirements & Communication Needs

### Documentation Status
- Updated `DOCS/CHECKPOINT.md` tracking implementation progress through Stage 2
- Added code documentation for API endpoints and component functionality
- Included comments for complex business logic and API interactions

### Documentation Needs
- More detailed API documentation for the Perplexity integration
- User guide for effective prompting of the AI assistant
- Documentation on how to extend the system with additional widgets

### Communication Requirements
- Clear requirements for Stage 3 router keywords and template formats
- Guidance on extending domain detection beyond current capabilities
- Feedback on current chat UI and potential improvements

## 4. Stakeholder Context & Feedback Integration

### Stakeholder Requirements Addressed
- **Technical Team**: Clean code structure with reusable components
- **Product Team**: Functional MVP with both visualization and conversational capabilities
- **DevOps**: Environment variable support for secure credential management
- **End Users**: Intuitive UI with graceful error handling and helpful feedback

### Potential Stakeholder Questions
- How to extend the domain detection to new business areas
- Performance implications of more complex AI prompts
- Data refresh strategy for real-world implementation
- Security considerations for sensitive financial data

## 5. Strategic Guidance Requests & Next Priorities

### Critical Decision Points
- Level of sophistication needed for keyword routing in Stage 3
- Template design for domain-specific AI responses
- Error handling strategy for production deployment
- Monitoring and logging requirements for AI interactions

### Next Implementation Priorities
- **Immediate (Stage 3)**: Implement keyword-based router for domain detection
- **Immediate (Stage 3)**: Create specialized templates for each business domain
- **Immediate (Stage 3)**: Enhance system prompt with contextual awareness
- **Immediate (Stage 3)**: Implement advanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Extended (Future)**: Consider real-time data integration, user authentication, and more sophisticated AI capabilities

### Resource Requirements
- Development time for implementing Stage 3 features
- Testing resources for validating router accuracy and template effectiveness
- Potential additional API costs for more complex AI interactions

## 6. Technical Debt & Future Considerations

### Known Technical Debt
- Limited test coverage across components and API functions
- Basic error handling that could be enhanced with retry logic
- CSS styling that could benefit from a more comprehensive design system
- Currently using basic fetch API without robust request management

### Architectural Expansion Points
- Potential for chat history persistence across sessions
- Opportunity for more sophisticated domain detection with ML/NLP
- Integration points for real financial data sources
- Expansion to additional widget types beyond the initial three

## 7. Current TODO List Status

### Completed Tasks
- Create mock data directory and files
- Implement BusinessUnits widget with mock data
- Implement TopCounterparties widget with mock data
- Implement MonthlyTrend widget with mock data
- Ensure layout matches requirement (cards + chat below)
- Add .env support for Perplexity API key
- Implement API chat endpoint for Netlify
- Implement API chat endpoint for Vercel
- Update chat client service
- Implement error handling in ChatPanel
- Update CHECKPOINT.md for Stage 2
- Commit changes with feat: stage2 chat backend integration

### Pending Tasks
- Implement keyword-based router for domain detection
- Create specialized templates for each business domain
- Enhance system prompt with contextual awareness
- Implement advanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Update CHECKPOINT.md for Stage 3

## 8. Handback Instructions

### Strategic Decisions Needed
- Confirm keyword detection strategy for domain routing
- Approve template format for domain-specific responses
- Determine balance between AI guidance vs. direct data answers

### Immediate Action Items
1. Review completed Stage 1 and Stage 2 implementations against requirements
2. Provide specific keywords to detect for each business domain
3. Clarify template format expectations for Stage 3
4. Consider any additional features needed before proceeding to Stage 3

### Communication Plan
- Continue updates through `DOCS/CHECKPOINT.md`
- Request review of domain detection logic before full implementation
- Consider demo of current functionality for stakeholder feedback
