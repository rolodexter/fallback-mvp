## Cache Test Results

### Test 1: First Run (Cache Miss)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "rows": [
    {
      "business_unit": "Navigation",
      "current_year_revenue_ars": 34800000,
      "previous_year_revenue_ars": 32000000,
      "yoy_pct": 8.75
    },
    {
      "business_unit": "Safety Equipment",
      "current_year_revenue_ars": 19600000,
      "previous_year_revenue_ars": 18000000,
      "yoy_pct": 8.89
    },
    {
      "business_unit": "Liferafts",
      "current_year_revenue_ars": 31300000,
      "previous_year_revenue_ars": 29000000,
      "yoy_pct": 7.93
    }
  ],
  "diagnostics": {
    "bytesProcessed": 840032,
    "jobId": "job_A3F9C2E1D0B8",
    "cacheHit": false,
    "executionTime": 1850,
    "template_id": "business_units_snapshot_yoy_v1",
    "params": {}
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Second Run (Cache Hit)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "rows": [
    {
      "business_unit": "Navigation",
      "current_year_revenue_ars": 34800000,
      "previous_year_revenue_ars": 32000000,
      "yoy_pct": 8.75
    },
    {
      "business_unit": "Safety Equipment",
      "current_year_revenue_ars": 19600000,
      "previous_year_revenue_ars": 18000000,
      "yoy_pct": 8.89
    },
    {
      "business_unit": "Liferafts",
      "current_year_revenue_ars": 31300000,
      "previous_year_revenue_ars": 29000000,
      "yoy_pct": 7.93
    }
  ],
  "diagnostics": {
    "cacheHit": true,
    "executionTime": 68,
    "template_id": "business_units_snapshot_yoy_v1",
    "params": {}
  }
}
```

## Performance Improvements

- **First run (cache miss)**: 1850ms execution time
- **Second run (cache hit)**: 68ms execution time
- **Performance improvement**: ~96% reduction in execution time

## Cache Validation

The cache implementation is working correctly as demonstrated by:

1. First query shows `cacheHit: false` with full BigQuery diagnostics
2. Second query shows `cacheHit: true` with significantly reduced execution time
3. No `bytesProcessed` or `jobId` in the second query, as it didn't need to execute BigQuery

## Stage 6 Lock-In Status

All Stage 6 deliverables have been successfully locked in:

- ✅ Cache abstraction implemented
- ✅ New templates added and working
- ✅ Router updated for new templates
- ✅ Diagnostics and guardrails implemented
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Deployed to Netlify and Vercel
- ✅ Cache functionality verified

The system is now production-ready with caching, new templates, and comprehensive diagnostics.
