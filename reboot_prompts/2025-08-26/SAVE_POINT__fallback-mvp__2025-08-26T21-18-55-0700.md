# ROLODEXTER SAVE POINT: BUSINESS UNIT ENRICHMENT IMPLEMENTATION

## TASK CONTEXT & CURRENT STATE

We are working on enhancing the Business Unit (BU) Query Response system in the Rolodexter fallback-mvp project. Specifically, we have been improving the detection and processing of queries about both the most important and least profitable business units, ensuring correct routing, SQL sorting, and multi-turn LLM enrichment integration into the chat handler.

### Recent Achievements

1. **Enhanced Router Pattern**:
   - Improved `topicRouter.ts` to detect queries about both most important/top and least profitable/worst business units.
   - Added support for queries that mention profit, revenue, or margin without explicitly mentioning business units (e.g., "most profitable ever").
   - Expanded business unit subject regex to include synonyms like "department" and "segment".
   - Added detection for temporal phrases like "ever", "all-time", "history", etc.

2. **Chat Handler Integration**:
   - Fixed the integration in `chat.ts` for business unit enrichment and synthesis.
   - Implemented robust handling for different shapes of template output data (`templateOutput`).
   - Added detailed logging to trace enrichment processing steps.
   - Implemented fallback mock data enrichment in demo mode with enriched narratives.

3. **TypeScript Interfaces**:
   - Updated `ExtendedTemplateResult` and created a new `TemplateOutput` interface.
   - Fixed TypeScript errors related to missing properties on `templateOutput`.

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Enhanced data mode detection to properly recognize `DATA_MODE=bq` as equivalent to "live".
   - Added detailed logging for data mode recognition.
   - Ensured the system uses live BigQuery data when available and falls back to mock data appropriately.

### Current Technical Challenges

1. **Data Mode Handling**:
   - The system now recognizes `DATA_MODE=bq` as equivalent to "live" mode.
   - Environment variable configuration for BigQuery needs to be validated for production use.
   - Testing is needed to verify live data retrieval and enrichment.

2. **Template Output Processing**:
   - The system now handles multiple valid data shapes (arrays, objects with data property, JSON strings).
   - Extensive validation and error handling ensures robustness against inconsistent data formats.

3. **Multi-Turn Conversation**:
   - Follow-up questions about specific business units are a logical next step for enhancement.
   - More refined handling of time periods and comparison questions would improve user experience.

## CURRENT SYSTEM STATE

### Active Files & Components

1. **Router Logic**: 
   - `src/data/router/topicRouter.ts` - Handles query detection and parameter extraction
   - Pattern matching for business unit queries with support for top/worst performers

2. **Enrichment Pipeline**:
   - `src/services/buEnrichment.ts` - Two-phase enrichment (analysis + synthesis)
   - Handles both top performer and underperformer context with specialized prompts

3. **Chat Handler**:
   - `netlify/functions/chat.ts` - Main API handler with template execution and response construction
   - Includes business unit enrichment integration and fallback mechanisms

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - `.env` - Contains configuration for data mode, API keys, and BigQuery settings
   - Currently set to use `DATA_MODE=bq` for live BigQuery data

### Integration Points

1. **BigQuery Connection**:
   - SQL templates executed against BigQuery or fallback to mock data
   - Environment variables control connection details and dataset selection

2. **LLM Provider (Perplexity)**:
   - Used for enrichment and synthesis of business unit narratives
   - Structured prompts for context generation and executive-friendly responses

3. **Client Rendering**:
   - Frontend components expect enriched responses with narrative text
   - Human-friendly business unit labels are provided for UI display

## PRIORITY TASKS & NEXT STEPS

1. **Testing Business Unit Queries**:
   - Test "most profitable ever" query to verify router pattern matching
   - Test "least profitable business unit" query to verify underperformer handling
   - Verify enrichment process works with both BigQuery and mock data

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Ensure BigQuery credentials are properly configured for production
   - Document the environment setup process for future developers

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update technical documentation for business unit enrichment
   - Create examples of effective business unit queries for users
   - Document the enrichment pipeline architecture

4. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Extend enrichment to other data domains (customers, products)
   - Implement multi-turn conversation flows for business unit exploration
   - Add visualization components for business unit performance data

## SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS & DEPENDENCIES

1. **Data Quality**:
   - Enrichment quality depends on accurate source data from BigQuery
   - Mock data provides fallback but should match live data structure

2. **LLM Response Variability**:
   - Prompts require structured JSON format requests
   - Multiple regex patterns needed to handle various response formats
   - Error handling required for parsing failures

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - BigQuery credentials and dataset access required for live mode
   - Environment variables control data mode and fallback behavior

## NAMING CONVENTIONS & PATTERNS

1. **Router Pattern Naming**:
   - `BU_RANK_BEST_PAT` - Pattern for top performers
   - `BU_RANK_WORST_PAT` - Pattern for underperformers
   - `BU_SUBJECT_PAT` - Pattern for business unit terms
   - `PROFIT_METRIC_PAT` - Pattern for profit-related terms

2. **Interface Naming**:
   - `BusinessUnitData` - Base interface for BU data
   - `EnrichedBusinessUnitData` - Extended interface with strategic context
   - `TemplateOutput` - Interface for template results
   - `ExtendedTemplateResult` - Interface for enriched template results

3. **Function Naming**:
   - `enrichBusinessUnitData()` - Performs first-phase enrichment
   - `synthesizeBuImportanceResponse()` - Creates narrative response
   - `labelizeWidgets()` - Adds human-friendly labels to UI widgets

## HANDBACK INSTRUCTIONS

This save point captures our progress on implementing and enhancing the Business Unit Enrichment feature in the Rolodexter fallback-mvp project. We have successfully:

1. Enhanced the router pattern to detect various forms of business unit queries
2. Fixed TypeScript errors in the business unit enrichment integration
3. Implemented proper handling of template output data structures
4. Updated environment configuration to correctly handle live and mock data modes

To continue where we left off, focus on:

1. Testing the "most profitable ever" query to verify router pattern improvements
2. Testing the "least profitable business unit" query for underperformer handling
3. Verifying BigQuery integration with the current environment configuration
4. Documenting the business unit enrichment pipeline and usage patterns
