# Generic LLM Responses Incident Report

## Incident Overview
**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Affected Systems:** Chat functionality in Fallback MVP Dashboard  
**Incident Owner:** Engineering Team

## Summary
The deployed application at https://fallback-mvp-dashboard.windsurf.build/ was returning generic LLM trivia responses instead of the intended domain-specific, grounded financial insights. This bypassed the router → template → grounding flow that should provide contextually relevant financial information.

## Timeline
- **2025-10-25:** Issue detected and reported
- **2025-10-25:** Investigation started
- **2025-10-25:** Root cause identified
- **2025-10-25:** Fixes implemented and deployed
- **2025-10-25:** Incident resolved

## Impact
Users received generic, ungrounded responses to their financial queries, reducing the application's value and potentially leading to incorrect information being presented. This undermined the core functionality of the financial assistant and damaged user trust.

## Root Cause
After thorough investigation, the following issues were identified:

1. **Primary Issue:** The chat component (`ChatPanel.tsx`) was using the deprecated `sendMessage()` method instead of the newer `sendChat()` method that properly implements grounding, domain routing, and template execution.

2. **Contributing Factors:**
   - Platform detection may fail in production environments when certain endpoints are unreachable
   - Missing or misconfigured environment variables in the Windsurf deployment
   - No error handling for missing grounding data or failed routing
   - Absence of clear error messages to indicate system failures

## Resolution
Implemented the following fixes:

1. Updated `ChatPanel.tsx` to use the current `sendChat()` method with proper error handling
2. Enhanced platform detection in `chatClient.ts` to use VITE_DEPLOY_PLATFORM environment variable as the primary detection method
3. Added better error handling in serverless functions to prevent falling back to raw LLM responses
4. Added validation checks for required environment variables with clear error messages

## Preventative Measures
To prevent similar incidents in the future:

1. Added comprehensive logging and monitoring for LLM response types
2. Implemented strict validation to prevent ungrounded queries from reaching the LLM
3. Added automated tests for the grounding pipeline
4. Improved documentation around environment variable requirements
5. Deprecated old methods have been removed to prevent accidental use

## Lessons Learned
1. Deprecated methods should be removed promptly after migration
2. Environment variable validation should be strict with clear error messages
3. Platform detection should have multiple fallback strategies
4. All LLM responses should be validated for grounding before being returned to users
