# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for implementing the fixes for the generic LLM responses issue in the Fallback MVP Dashboard.

## Phase 1: Code Changes

### 1. ChatPanel.tsx Update
- Replace `sendMessage()` with `sendChat()` method
- Add proper error handling
- Estimated time: 1 hour
- Risk level: Low

### 2. chatClient.ts Improvements
- Enhance platform detection to prioritize environment variables
- Remove deprecated `sendMessage()` method
- Add comprehensive logging
- Estimated time: 2 hours
- Risk level: Medium

### 3. Serverless Function Enhancements
- Add robust environment variable validation
- Improve error handling
- Enhance response validation
- Estimated time: 2 hours
- Risk level: Medium

## Phase 2: Testing

### 1. Unit Tests
- Update unit tests for modified components
- Add tests for platform detection edge cases
- Test environment variable validation
- Estimated time: 3 hours
- Risk level: Low

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test the full grounding pipeline
- Verify platform detection across environments
- Test error handling scenarios
- Estimated time: 4 hours
- Risk level: Medium

### 3. Smoke Tests
- Execute smoke test plan in staging environment
- Document results and fix any issues
- Estimated time: 2 hours
- Risk level: Low

## Phase 3: Deployment

### 1. Staging Deployment
- Deploy to staging environment
- Verify all environment variables
- Execute smoke tests
- Estimated time: 2 hours
- Risk level: Low

### 2. Production Deployment
- Schedule deployment window
- Update environment variables if needed
- Deploy code changes
- Execute verification steps
- Estimated time: 2 hours
- Risk level: Medium

### 3. Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Monitor for 48 hours after deployment
- Check for any generic responses
- Review logs for warnings or errors
- Estimated time: Ongoing
- Risk level: Low

## Phase 4: Documentation and Follow-up

### 1. Documentation Updates
- Update API documentation
- Document grounding pipeline architecture
- Update environment variable requirements
- Estimated time: 3 hours
- Risk level: Low

### 2. Knowledge Sharing
- Present findings to engineering team
- Review lessons learned
- Discuss preventative measures
- Estimated time: 1 hour
- Risk level: Low

## Timeline

| Phase | Task | Day | Time Estimate | Owner |
|-------|------|-----|---------------|-------|
| 1 | Code Changes | Day 1 | 5 hours | |
| 2 | Testing | Day 1-2 | 9 hours | |
| 3 | Deployment | Day 3 | 4 hours | |
| 4 | Documentation | Day 4 | 4 hours | |

## Rollback Plan

In case issues are detected after deployment:

1. Revert code changes to last known good state
2. Verify environment variables
3. Deploy previous version
4. Notify stakeholders

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All chat interactions receive properly grounded responses
2. No generic LLM responses are observed in production
3. Platform detection works reliably across environments
4. All smoke tests pass in production
5. No related errors or warnings in logs
