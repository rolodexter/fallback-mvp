# Lessons Learned

This document captures key insights and lessons learned during the implementation of the mock data mode.

## Technical Insights

### 1. Decoupling Data Sources from Business Logic

- **Benefit**: By implementing a clean separation between data sources and business logic via the `DATA_MODE` toggle, we created a more flexible and testable architecture.
- **Lesson**: This design pattern allows us to develop and test the user experience independently from complex data integrations.

### 2. Template-First Development

- **Benefit**: Building templates with mock data first allowed us to rapidly iterate on the response format and structure without waiting for BigQuery integration.
- **Lesson**: This approach ensures that when we do integrate with BigQuery, we have a clear target for the expected data structure and quality.

### 3. Deterministic Responses

- **Benefit**: Mock mode provides consistent, reliable responses for demos and testing.
- **Lesson**: Having deterministic responses helps with testing, debugging, and QA processes, especially when demonstrating the application to stakeholders.

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. Ensuring Parity Between Serverless Functions

- **Challenge**: Maintaining consistent behavior between Vercel and Netlify functions required careful attention to detail.
- **Solution**: We standardized the response structure and error handling between both implementations.

### 2. LLM Parameter Management

- **Challenge**: Different implementations had slightly different parameter orders for the LLM provider function.
- **Solution**: Standardized the interface across implementations to avoid confusion and bugs.

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

- **Challenge**: Determining when to abstain vs. provide fallback responses.
- **Solution**: Implemented a clear abstention policy when data is unavailable, with specific reason codes to improve debuggability.

## Future Improvements

### 1. Automated Testing

- Adding more comprehensive automated tests would help ensure continued parity between implementations.
- Consider implementing integration tests that verify the entire request-response cycle.

### 2. Template Management

- The current template system works well but could benefit from a more structured approach to template versioning and testing.
- Consider implementing a template registry with version tracking.

### 3. Caching Strategy

- For the next phase with BigQuery, implementing a smart caching strategy will be crucial for performance.
- The mock mode implementation provides a good foundation for adding this capability later.
